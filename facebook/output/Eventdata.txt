At the heart of this month-long festival will be Liverpool’s Central Library, which once again opens its doors following intricate restoration. The festival kicks off on World Book Night on 23 April. Liverpool ONE is celebrating the festival in a unique way unveiling bespoke Reading Trees as well as inviting you to contribute to our very first literary masterpiece “A Tale Of ONE City”. READING TREES Spring is in the air and we are inviting visitors to sit under the shade of a tree and enjoy a good story. From 23 April – 2 June Liverpool ONE is hosting Words on the Street - with four wooden Reading Trees popping up around our shopping district. The 2.6m high trees will give shoppers the opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life and get lost in a good book. Designed by Laurie Crombie and Mike Lill from The Kazimier, the trees will be stocked with books and you are invited to take a seat & lose yourself in a novel or two! Bring in your own books to stock our Reading Trees and swap a read!* *NB: All books will be donated to a good cause after the festival is finished. If you want to swap a book please be kind enough to leave one of the same quality behind for somebody else to enjoy. A TALE OF ONE CITY Fancy yourself as a budding author? Then come and help us as we write our very own story! The story is set in Liverpool and follows 2 female characters Olivia & Elizabeth who are in their twenties - the rest is up to you! Here’s how it works: Starting on World Book Night each collaborator has the chance to add 3 sentences to the story in sequence, only being allowed to see what the previous person has contributed. You will not be able to see the rest of the story, just the previous 3 sentences! Once the surreal tale is complete it will be emailed as a finished manuscript to all participants. The story will be facilitated by Impropriety, an improvised comedy group based in Liverpool, to inspire and ensure all content is appropriate! You can participate in writing the tale on the dates and times below: World Book Night: 23 April 12pm-6pm Sat 27 April: 12pm – 4pm Sat 4 May: 12pm – 4pm Sat 11 May: 12pm – 4pm Sat 18 May: 12pm – 4pm|2013-04-18|13:25:32|2013-04-22|23:00:00|null|null|Liverpool ONE Official|Liverpool|United Kingdom|53.404288509658|-2.9862800851512|Wall Street|L1 8JQ
